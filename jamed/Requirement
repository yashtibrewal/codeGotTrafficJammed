Every time we copy the testcases and then paste it as an input to our program.
Problem:
Check if my output is same as the expected output.
Manual Checking is a pain. Automation is the key.
CodeJam expects main function read write using Scanners and Sysouts.

Posssible Solution:
1. Keep 2 files. 1 as Input for testcases. One as expected output of the code.
2. Keep Scanners in the main at the same time.
3. Maintain 2 versions of the code, one which runs locally, other which we need to submit.
4. WAP to check if 2 files are exactly the same.
